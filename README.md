# FEATURE SELECTION OF REVIEWS USING CROSS VALIDATION PSO
# ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to develop a sophisticated sentiment analysis system using Python that goes beyond traditional approaches by not only collecting general opinion in reviews, but also identifying and prioritizing key aspects or attributes that significantly influence the expressed sentiment. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user reviews, extract relevant aspects and assess their impact on sentiment polarity. With the help of advanced machine learning algorithms, the system understands the opinions of users in many ways and provides valuable information to companies and decision makers. It is expected that the project and its results will improve the accuracy and depth of sentiment analysis, leading to more informed decisions based on a detailed understanding of customer opinions and preferences.
# PROPOSED SYSTEM
Overview of the Proposed System 
The proposed system aims to perform a facet level analysis on customer feedback for Flipkart products using a combination of supervised and unsupervised techniques. The goal of this approach is to distinguish aspects and associate feelings with each identified aspect, providing valuable information about customer opinions about specific product attributes.
In the controlled approach, the system uses initial words that indicate certain characteristics of the products. These seed words help the model recognize and label sentences with corresponding aspects. For example, if the sentence starts with the word "battery life", the model will label this aspect with "battery life". This approach is effective in providing accurate aspect-level sentiment analysis, especially when the seed words are carefully selected to cover many aspects.
On the other hand, the unsupervised approach uses topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to hide hidden aspects of sentences without the need for manually entered seed words. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large data sets, where initializing each statement can become a complex and time- consuming task. With LDA, the system can automatically identify common themes or topics in the feedback data, which can then be associated with specific aspects of the products.
The system follows typical natural language processing (NLP), which includes several important steps. First, the data is processed to remove noise and irrelevant information. Features are then extracted from the preprocessed data using methods such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization. These features are input to facet-level sentiment analysis models that are trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics. The models' performance is assessed using pertinent metrics like precision, recall, and F1 scores to guarantee that the system can accurately identify features and associate emotions with them. The system will be optimized to achieve high accuracy in identifying looks and combining feelings, providing valuable information on customer opinions on Flipkart products.

Proposed System Algorithm and Methodology
The report provides an in-depth analysis of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for facet-based sentiment analysis. In the Figure 4.1 depicts the block diagram of the proposed system in a paragraph the pipeline includes key components such as data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and assessment. The process uses various algorithms and techniques to streamline the analysis process and improve sensory classification accuracy.

Data Loading and Preprocessing
The NLP pipeline starts by loading data from an SQLite database. It then preprocesses the text data, including handling missing values, removing URLs, normalizing Unicode characters, managing emoticons and emoticons, tagging words, stopping word deletion, derivation using the Porter Stemmer algorithm, lemmatization using SpaCy, and language detection. Using data augmentation techniques such as antonym augmentation to generate synthetic reviews. The custom preprocessing function is configured to efficiently combine different preprocessing steps.

Feature Extraction
Feature selection in classification models involves identifying significant features. For sentiment analysis, reviews are separated into words and added to a feature vector. filter based, coil based or embedded are used. Pragmatic features consider the use of words in context, while emoticons, punctuation marks and slang words convey emotions.

Nature Inspired Algorithm
Optimizing bee colonies works like bees foraging. Bees explore opportunities (salary bees), share findings (observer bees) and search new areas (scout bees) to find the best solutions. It effectively solves optimization problems, including feature selection.

Sentimental Analysis
Sentiment analysis entails identifying and computationally categorizing opinions expressed in text to ascertain whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. It analyzes text data to extract subjective information such as feelings, opinions and attitudes to understand the feelings of the text.

Sentiment Classification
Sentiment classification is a form of text classification that categorizes a text into various emotional categories, like positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze text and determine the sentiment expressed in it. The purpose of sentiment classification is to automatically classify text based on the feelings or opinions conveyed in the text.
